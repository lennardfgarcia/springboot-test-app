# Spring Framework & Spring Boot – Course Practice

This repository contains my hands-on code and notes from the **Spring Framework & Spring Boot** course by John Thompson on Udemy. I'm using this to solidify my understanding of Spring Core, Dependency Injection, MVC, JPA, and full-stack app development using Spring Boot.

##  Work in Progress

I'm currently progressing through the course and updating this repo as I complete each section.  Some folders may contain incomplete notes or starter projects.
